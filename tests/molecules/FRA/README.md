This example is meant to test whather we can correctly load a ligand with proper residue name.
The input contains structure stored in PDB format and the output is an isomeric SMILES describing this structure.

Here we use FRA as an example.
You can find the ligand entry [here](https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/FRA) and a PDB structure, from with the input was extracted [here](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1a4k).
